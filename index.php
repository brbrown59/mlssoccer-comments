		<h2>Persona</h2>
		<p>The user of the commenting feature will almost certainly be a fan of the sport of soccer - and of Major League Soccer in particular - and would likely have some degree of knowledge in the sport.
			They would likely be American (either by birth or current residence), as MLS is an American league.
			American soccer fans tend to be teens and young adults (millenials) and often have roots in a country where the sport is more widespread (such as immigrants or first generation Americans).
			Younger generations, in general, are typically more comfortable around technology, and heavily use mobile devices such as smart phones in particular.
			Someone who comments on the site would be looking to discuss the sport (and the contents of a given article) with other fans.
			They are most likely to be drawn into reading and commenting articles about their favorite team, so most other commentators they interact with will be fans of the team, as well.
